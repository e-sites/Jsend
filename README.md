JSend 2.0 - WORK IN PROGRESS
=====

## You are warned, this is not a stable branch yet ##

JSend is a native AJAX implementation that strictly handles JSend responses according to the non-official JSend spec. Whilst the spec provides rules for a consistent JSON response, our script gives developers the functionality to handle the actual communication based on this format.

More info, demo's and unit tests can be found at: [github.e-sites.nl/jsend](http://github.e-sites.nl/jsend)

## The spec
Never heard of the JSend spec? As stated on the [OmniTI Labs site](http://labs.omniti.com/labs/jsend):

> Put simply, JSend is a specification that lays down some rules for how JSON responses from web servers should be formatted. JSend focuses on application-level (as opposed to protocol- or transport-level) messaging which makes it ideal for use in REST-style applications and APIs.

A basic JSend-compliant response is as simple as this:

```js
{
	status : "success",
	data : {
		"post" : { "id" : 1, "title" : "A blog post", "body" : "content" }
	}
}
```

Internally we handle all the necessary validation, for example if the corresponding keys (i.e. status and data or message) are present and if their values are allowed (in case of the status key: either succes, fail or error). This means you can skip the validation logic in your callbacks and focus directly on handling the data. Out of the box we also provide error handling when XHR fails for some reason.

### Why JSend?
Well, the guys at OmniTI sum it up quite nicely:

> If you're a library or framework developer, this gives you a consistent format which your users are more likely to already be familiar with, which means they'll already know how to consume and interact with your code. If you're a web app developer, you won't have to think about how to structure the JSON data in your application, and you'll have existing reference implementations to get you up and running quickly.

Basically, if you like the format that the spec lays out and you want to use it as a default for all Ajax communication, JSend might be the script you're looking for.

## Implementation
The implementation is easy as pie. You'll need to add the following script in your HTML (preferbly just before the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> closing tag):

```html
<script src="jsend-2.0.0.min.js"></script>
```

Initiating an actual XHR can be accomplished as follows:

```js
JSend
.get('/xhr/entrypoint', {foo: bar})
.then(function (res, xhr) {
    console.log(res); // response object
    console.log(res.status); // response status
    console.log(res.data); // response data
    console.log(xhr); // xhr object
});
```
## PHP entrypoint
In our repo we have included a single entrypoint named `xhr.php`, all communication will go through this file. Inside this file we just use a couple classes to handle the different scenario's. Now, it doesn't really matter how simple (or complex) this code is. As long as you return valid JSON (i.e. compliant with the JSend spec), you're good to go.

## Roadmap
* more unit tests
* write more (and better) documentation
* add more demo's (e.g. how to handle errors et cetera)
* â€¦any other suggestions? Mail us at github [at] e-sites.nl or fork JSend :)

## Credits
Big shout out to the devs at OmniTI 'for speccing out' a consistent JSON format.
